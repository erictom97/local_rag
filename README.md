# Offline Document Query Application

This application allows users to upload documents and ask questions about the content using a locally hosted large language model (LLM) managed by Ollama. The application runs completely offline and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers based on the document's content.

## Features

- **Offline Operation**: Runs entirely offline, leveraging Ollama to manage LLMs locally.
- **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents to the application.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions about the uploaded documents, and the application provides answers using RAG.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- `pip` (Python package installer).

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

#### Docker Setup

2. **Pull the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull dockerhubuser/myapplication:latest
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 dockerhubuser/myapplication:latest
   ```

#### Python Setup

4. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

6. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Access the Application**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application interface.

2. **Upload Documents**:
   Use the provided interface to upload documents that you want to query.

3. **Ask Questions**:
   Enter questions related to the uploaded document, and the application will provide answers using the LLM.

### Example Workflow

1. **Start the Application**:
   Ensure the application is running by executing the Docker run command.

2. **Upload a Document**:
   Navigate to the document upload section and select a document to upload.

3. **Query the Document**:
   After the document is uploaded, use the query interface to ask questions about the document's content. The application retrieves relevant information and generates answers using the LLM.

## Architecture

### Key Components

- **Ollama**: Manages and runs large language models locally, ensuring the application can function without an internet connection.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Benefits

- **Offline Capability**: Suitable for environments with limited or no internet access.
- **Enhanced Query Accuracy**: Combines retrieval and generation techniques for more accurate answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based interface for easy document upload and querying.
